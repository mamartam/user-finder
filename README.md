# User finder
This project was created based on a Frontend Mentor [https://www.frontendmentor.io/] challenge. The layout and design idea come from Frontend Mentor, while the code implementation is my own.

## 📦 Technologies

- HTML5 – for building the page structure
- CSS3 – for styling the layout, animations, and responsive design
- JavaScript (ES6) – for fetching data from API, filtering users, and handling events
  - Fetch API – to get user data from an external source
  - JSONPlaceholder API – as a fake REST API for testing and learning
- Google Fonts (Montserrat) – for custom typography

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to work with Fetch API and get data from an external API
- How to use async/await and handle errors with try...catch
- How to display dynamic data on the page using JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- How to filter an array of objects based on user input
- How to add and remove classes to create simple animations
- How to handle user interactions such as click and input events
- How to build a small responsive interface using CSS and media queries

## 🚀 How It Can Be Improved

- Add more user information (email, phone, avatar) instead of showing it in an alert
- Improve UI/UX with better animations and smoother transitions
- Add keyboard navigation and better accessibility support
- Implement debounce for search input to improve performance
- Add loading and error states while fetching data
- Refactor the code into smaller functions for better readability
